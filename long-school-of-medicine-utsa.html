        <h2>Education & Research</h2>
        <p>
          The first two years use an integrated, system-based curriculum with early clinical exposure through the Longitudinal Clinical Experience.  
          Students may join the Dean’s Summer Research Program between M1 and M2, working with faculty on biomedical or clinical projects and presenting at symposia.  
          Research strengths include cancer (Mays Cancer Center), diabetes, aging (Barshop Institute), and community health.  
          Optional MD/MPH and MD/PhD tracks are available for those pursuing in-depth research careers.

        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Setting:</strong> Academic Health Center environment—hospitals and clinics within walking distance in the Medical Center district.  
          San Antonio offers a rich cultural scene, the River Walk, Tex-Mex cuisine, and a friendly, affordable city atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Housing:</strong> No on-campus dorms; students rent in nearby neighborhoods (Oak Hills, Leon Valley, Alamo Heights).  
          UT Health assists with off-campus listings; most commute by car, and parking is plentiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Culture:</strong> Supportive, collegial atmosphere with dozens of student organizations (specialty interest, service, wellness).  
          Active community service through clinics like Frontera de Salud.  
          Campus traditions include Fiesta Med events and wellness programming to balance academics and life.
