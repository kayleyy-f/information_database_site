  </ul>

  <h2>Admissions</h2>

    <li><strong>Primary application deadline:</strong> October 30 (approximate; follows the TMDSAS timeline for Texas public medical schools, which is usually Oct. 1 for submission, but UH offers an extended deadline around end of October in recent cycles).</li>
    <li><strong>Application review start date:</strong> Mid-summer. UH begins reviewing applications in July and August on a rolling basis, once primary applications are verified and secondary applications are received.</li>
    <li><strong>Application system:</strong> TMDSAS. As a Texas public medical school, Fertitta Family College of Medicine uses the TMDSAS application platform for all applicants.</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary application fee:</strong> $50. (UH’s secondary application fee is relatively low, and fee waivers are offered for eligible financially disadvantaged applicants.)</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>The Fertitta Family College of Medicine emphasizes community-focused medical education. A cornerstone of the curriculum is the Longitudinal Primary Care program, where students are paired with community clinics to learn first-hand about primary care in underserved settings. Research opportunities at UH’s College of Medicine center on community health, health disparities, and population health management, aligning with its social mission. Students undertake a mandatory <em>Student Scholarly Project</em> (SSP) spanning their four years – often a research or quality improvement project targeting a local health need. The College’s Office of Research supports students in identifying research mentors and projects, and partnerships with UH’s existing health research centers allow medical students to join ongoing studies. While the institution is new (welcoming its first class in 2020), it is building research programs in healthcare innovation, telehealth, and preventive medicine. Research is considered important primarily as it relates to improving community health outcomes; many students graduate having completed projects on topics like epidemiology in Houston’s underserved neighborhoods or interventions to manage chronic diseases in primary care settings.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $24,268 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. Including living expenses, the total in-state cost of attendance is roughly $56-60k per year.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $37,368 per year for non-residents:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. (Total out-of-state yearly cost of attendance is around $70k.) Notably, UH’s med school is primarily focused on Texas residents and has relatively few out-of-state students.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> The UH College of Medicine is situated on the University of Houston’s main campus in an urban area of Houston. Students enjoy the benefits of a large university setting – including access to campus amenities, libraries, recreation centers, and collegiate events – while also being in proximity to the Texas Medical Center (a short drive away). Houston’s mix of “coastal charm, suburban convenience, and urban excitement” offers a variety of lifestyles for students:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. Many enjoy Houston’s affordable cost of living compared to other big cities, as well as its diverse communities and cuisines.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Medical students at UH typically live off-campus in the Houston area. Some choose to live near the UH campus or in neighborhoods like Midtown or the Museum District, which provide reasonable commutes. The University of Houston does offer graduate housing options, and medical students may opt for on-campus apartments available to graduate/professional students, though many prefer off-campus apartments or rental homes. Because the College of Medicine is new, the student body is small, and many students form cohorts to find housing together. Houston’s public transit (including light rail and buses) can connect students from housing to campus and clinical sites, though having a car is common.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> As a new medical school with a social mission, UH’s College of Medicine has a close-knit and enthusiastic student community. Class sizes are small (around 30–60 students per class initially), which fosters strong camaraderie and collaboration rather than competition. The campus culture is service-oriented: from day one, students participate in community outreach, such as health fairs and mobile clinics in underserved Houston neighborhoods. Student organizations are growing and include groups like a Family Medicine Interest Group, a SNMA chapter (Student National Medical Association) focused on minority student support, and various specialty interest groups forming as the school grows. A notable aspect of student life is the integration with the broader University of Houston—medical students join university-wide intramural sports or graduate student councils, bringing an interprofessional flavor to their experience. The College’s focus on primary care and social determinants of health means that many student activities revolve around community engagement, leadership in free clinics, and advocacy projects. Despite being a new institution, UH’s medical students are quickly building traditions, such as a yearly service project day and mentorship programs that pair each incoming student with a faculty and a community physician mentor. Overall, campus life at the Fertitta Family College of Medicine is defined by a pioneering spirit, community involvement, and the vibrant backdrop of the UH campus and Houston city life.</p>
