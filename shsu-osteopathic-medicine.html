  <h1>Sam Houston State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (SHSU-COM)</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classes begin:</strong> Early August. The SHSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, which welcomed its first class in 2020, typically starts the academic year in early August, after orientation in late July.</li>
    <li><strong>Campus type:</strong> Suburban/Rural. SHSU-COM is located in Conroe, Texas (Montgomery County), a suburban area north of Houston with a more rural surrounding – the campus offers a mix of a small-town feel and proximity to the Houston metro.</li>
    <li><strong>Application deadline:</strong> Primary application deadline is around March 15 (via AACOMAS, as an osteopathic school). However, the college uses rolling admissions, so early application (in summer/fall) is encouraged. Secondaries typically have a deadline in spring (e.g., April).</li>
    <li><strong>Mission:</strong> The college was established in 2019 “with a mission to expand healthcare availability to rural communities and address the shortage of primary care physicians in Texas.”:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36} In alignment with osteopathic philosophy, its mission centers on producing community-focused primary care doctors for underserved and rural Texas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Admissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary application deadline:</strong> March 15 (AACOMAS application for the DO program). The application cycle opens in May, and SHSU-COM reviews applications on a rolling basis until the final deadline in mid-March.</li>
    <li><strong>Application review start date:</strong> Late summer. The admissions team begins reviewing completed AACOMAS applications as early as July and extending interview invites starting in August/September, continuing on a rolling basis.</li>
    <li><strong>Application system:</strong> AACOMAS (American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service) is used to apply to SHSU’s osteopathic medicine program.</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary application fee:</strong> $75. (After the primary AACOMAS is received, SHSU-COM sends qualified applicants a secondary; the fee is around $75.)</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary application deadline:</strong> April 1. (Typically, secondaries should be submitted by early spring; since admissions are rolling, earlier submission is advisable well before this deadline.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Acceptance Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Median MCAT:</strong> ~506. The average MCAT for matriculants has been around 506:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}, which is on par with national osteopathic averages and reflects SHSU-COM’s holistic admissions (looking beyond just scores).</li>
    <li><strong>Median GPA:</strong> ~3.65. The entering class median GPA is roughly 3.6–3.7:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}, indicating solid academic backgrounds, with an emphasis on well-rounded candidates committed to primary care.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>SHSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine provides a curriculum focused on primary care and rural medicine. The DO curriculum integrates osteopathic principles and hands-on clinical training from early on. Students learn osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) in a dedicated lab and are taught to approach patients holistically. The first two years are mostly campus-based in Conroe, with basic science courses integrated with clinical systems and early clinical skills practice (including experiences in the simulation center and with standardized patients). A unique aspect of SHSU-COM is its intentional training for rural and underserved settings – students have opportunities to rotate in community clinics across East Texas. In terms of research, as a new school, formal research programs are growing. The emphasis is on community and population health research rather than bench laboratory science. Students may engage in research on rural health outcomes, public health interventions, or primary care best practices. There is a Scholarly Activity requirement, which can be fulfilled by research or quality improvement projects. Given SHSU-COM’s mission, many faculty research interests lie in telehealth for rural populations, substance abuse in underserved areas, or healthcare delivery innovations for small communities. While research is not the primary focus for most SHSU-COM students (many of whom are more clinically oriented), the institution encourages inquisitiveness and provides mentorship for students who do seek research experiences. Overall, the education is geared toward producing excellent osteopathic clinicians for Texas communities, with research serving as a tool to improve community health and medical education.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees are approximately $26,500 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. (This reflects a recent tuition reduction after receiving state funding:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. Including living expenses, in-state COA is about $55-60k/year.)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees for non-residents are about $41,600 per year:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. (Total out-of-state COA around $70k/year. SHSU-COM, as a public institution, now receives state support and offers a significant tuition discount for Texas residents.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> The SHSU College of Osteopathic Medicine is in Conroe, a community about 40 miles north of Houston. The campus is a newly built medical school facility designed specifically for osteopathic training:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}. It is nestled on 7.3 acres of wooded land, giving it a calm, natural atmosphere even as commercial development grows around it:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}. Students enjoy a quieter environment than a big city – Conroe offers a suburban lifestyle with nearby parks and Lake Conroe for outdoor recreation – but Houston’s resources are a short drive away if needed. The region’s mix of rural and suburban settings provides students with a feel for the communities they are being trained to serve.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Many SHSU-COM students live in Conroe or surrounding Montgomery County. Housing tends to be more spacious and affordable than in major cities. Some students rent apartments or townhomes in Conroe, while others choose to live slightly further south in The Woodlands (a master-planned community about 20 minutes away with more entertainment and shopping options) and commute. Because the class size is modest (around 75 students per class), many students get to know each other and find roommates easily. There is no on-campus housing provided by SHSU-COM, but the school’s location near SHSU’s Center at The Woodlands means students can tap into university housing resources and listings. The “wooded” campus design:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44} gives a sense of campus community; between classes, students can relax in the comfortable student lounge or even outside in green spaces around the building. Parking is ample and free on campus, a perk of the suburban location.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> As a brand-new medical school with a tight-knit cohort, SHSU-COM has a very supportive and pioneer-spirited culture. Students and faculty are collaboratively shaping traditions together. There is a strong emphasis on mentorship – each student is paired with a faculty mentor and often with an osteopathic physician in the community. Because the mission centers on primary care and serving rural Texas, students share a common sense of purpose and service. Organizations and interest groups are quickly forming: there are chapters of national osteopathic organizations like SAAO (for OMM enthusiasts) and SAACOFP (for future family physicians), a Rural Medicine Student Association, and community service groups that organize health fairs in East Texas towns. Students frequently volunteer for rotations at clinics in medically underserved areas, which also fosters camaraderie through shared travel and experiences. The college also instills wellness and balance; being part of Sam Houston State University, students have access to main campus events and even Bearkat sports if they wish, though the med school is geographically separate. Socially, the students often gather for study groups that double as potlucks or meetups at local spots in Conroe or The Woodlands. There is a sense of family – faculty know students by name, and upperclassmen (now that the school has multiple classes) actively help mentor incoming students about adjusting to the intense coursework. In summary, campus life at SHSU College of Osteopathic Medicine is characterized by a close community in a tranquil environment, unified by the goal of becoming compassionate physicians for communities in need.</p>
