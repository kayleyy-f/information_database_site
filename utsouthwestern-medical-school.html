  <h1>University of Texas Southwestern Medical School (UTSW)</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classes begin:</strong> Early August. UT Southwestern’s first-year orientation and classes typically start in early August, aligning with the UT system schedule (after a brief orientation in late July).</li>
    <li><strong>Campus type:</strong> Urban. UTSW is in Dallas’ Southwestern Medical District, an urban academic medical center environment. The campus consists of hospitals (Parkland Memorial, Clements University Hospital), research buildings, and education facilities in a dense, urban setting near downtown Dallas.</li>
    <li><strong>Application deadline:</strong> Primary application due Oct. 1 (TMDSAS). Secondary application deadlines usually by Nov. 15. UTSW, as part of TMDSAS, adheres to the Texas match timeline, with rolling interview invites and final offers per the match in February.</li>
    <li><strong>Mission:</strong> UT Southwestern’s mission encompasses a three-part charge: “to EDUCATE physicians, scientists, and caregivers optimally prepared to serve the needs of patients and society; to DISCOVER research that solves for unmet needs by finding better treatments, cures, and prevention; and to HEAL patients with compassion and innovation,” thus promoting health in the community and beyond:contentReference[oaicite:91]{index=91}. In essence, UTSW aims to train exceptional clinicians and researchers and to advance science and healthcare (its motto might be summarized as “to heal, innovate, and educate”:contentReference[oaicite:92]{index=92}).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Admissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary application deadline:</strong> October 1 (via TMDSAS for UTSW).</li>
    <li><strong>Application review start date:</strong> Early summer. UTSW’s admissions committee typically starts reviewing applications in July, and interview invitations begin as early as August. UTSW has a highly competitive, rolling interview process (with a preference for Texas residents as required by law, though they do take some out-of-state).</li>
    <li><strong>Application system:</strong> TMDSAS (for all applicants; non-Texas residents apply through TMDSAS specifically to UTSW as well).</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary application fee:</strong> $00. UTSW does not charge an additional secondary application fee – their secondary is integrated into TMDSAS (applicants simply complete UTSW-specific questions online once invited, without a fee).</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary application deadline:</strong> November 15. (All secondary materials, including evaluation letters, must be in by mid-November to ensure consideration before the match list is compiled.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Acceptance Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Median MCAT:</strong> ~516. UTSW’s median MCAT score for entering students is approximately 516:contentReference[oaicite:93]{index=93}, placing it among the higher tier (94th percentile or so), which reflects its status as a top-tier medical school.</li>
    <li><strong>Median GPA:</strong> ~3.89. The median GPA is around 3.89:contentReference[oaicite:94]{index=94}, indicating that most accepted students have near-perfect academic records. UTSW’s admissions are academically very selective, though they also look for research and leadership experiences heavily.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>UT Southwestern is renowned for its strong research and academic rigor. The medical curriculum at UTSW is traditional in structure but innovative in implementation. The first 18 months are pre-clinical with integrated basic sciences and early clinical skills training. UTSW has recently incorporated more small-group learning and integrated physiology/pathology courses to modernize its curriculum. Students begin clinical rotations in the latter half of the second year and then spend the third and fourth years in clerkships and electives across UT Southwestern’s outstanding clinical affiliates (Parkland Hospital, one of the nation’s busiest public hospitals, William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, Children’s Medical Center Dallas, and others). These rotations provide exposure to a vast array of pathology and patient populations; for example, Parkland is famed for trauma and indigent care, providing unparalleled learning experiences.</p>
  <p>Research is arguably a hallmark of UTSW. Many faculty are Nobel laureates or members of the National Academy of Sciences, and the campus is a hub of biomedical discovery. Students have abundant opportunities to engage in research; in fact, a significant portion of UTSW students take a year-out for research or are part of the combined MD/PhD Medical Scientist Training Program. Even those not on the PhD track often spend a summer between first and second year doing a funded research project (through programs like the Sarnoff or an internal Summer Research Program). The emphasis on “DISCOVER” in the mission:contentReference[oaicite:95]{index=95} is reflected in the curriculum: UTSW encourages scholarly activity by requiring a Scholarly Activity (which can be fulfilled by a research project or other academic pursuit). The institution’s strengths in research areas such as molecular genetics, neuroscience, oncology, and pharmacology mean students can find projects in almost any field of interest. Additionally, UTSW’s facilities like the Simmons Cancer Center and the Center for Translational Medicine support cutting-edge clinical trials and translational research, which students can join. Simply put, UTSW is among the top research medical schools in the country, and students who have research aspirations find a well-funded, mentor-rich environment here. That said, UTSW also prides itself on clinical excellence – it produces a large number of specialists and subspecialists, and its residency match list is one of the most impressive nationally. In summary, education at UTSW is rigorous and comprehensive, and research is not just an opportunity but almost part of the culture, aligning with UTSW’s vision to be at the forefront of advancing medicine.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $25,122 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:96]{index=96}. (Including living expenses, in-state COA is roughly $63k/year. UTSW has one of the lowest tuitions for a top-ranked med school, thanks to state support. Many students also secure scholarships especially if they have outstanding credentials or financial need.)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $38,737 per year for non-residents:contentReference[oaicite:97]{index=97}. (Total out-of-state COA ~$76k/year. However, UTSW is required to cap out-of-state enrollment to a small percentage, so very few pay this rate. Also, if out-of-state students receive any competitive scholarship of $1,000 or more, they qualify for in-state tuition rates by Texas law:contentReference[oaicite:98]{index=98}, which many do.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> UT Southwestern is in Dallas, a large and diverse metropolitan city. The Southwestern Medical District where the school resides is a cluster of hospitals, research institutes, and academic buildings, so it feels like a “city within a city” focused on healthcare. However, just outside the med district, Dallas offers everything from arts (Dallas Arts District is one of the largest in the U.S.) to sports (Dallas Mavericks NBA, Dallas Cowboys not far away) to vibrant nightlife (Uptown, Deep Ellum). Students at UTSW can enjoy big-city living: excellent restaurants (Dallas has every cuisine, reflecting its international populace), music venues, and events. At the same time, the campus is self-contained enough that daily life revolves around classmates and colleagues in the med center, which fosters a close community despite being in a huge city.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Many UTSW students choose to live very close to campus. Notably, UTSW offers on-campus apartments, the <em>Southwestern Medical Park Apartments</em>, with 282 units specifically for students and staff:contentReference[oaicite:99]{index=99}. These are within walking distance (or a short shuttle) to lecture halls and the hospitals, and many med students opt to live there especially in the pre-clinical years. Others live in nearby neighborhoods like Oak Lawn, Uptown, or along the DART (light rail) line, which runs through the medical district. The cost of living in Dallas is moderate compared to other major cities; apartments near campus are reasonably priced, and often students will have roommates to save costs. During clinical years, some students might move closer to downtown or different parts of the city, but since most rotations are in the med district, staying nearby is convenient. Parking is available on campus for a fee, but many students who live nearby just walk or bike. Dallas also has public transit lines and student discounts, but a car is useful for more distant experiences (some rotations might be at affiliated clinics in suburbs). In summary, housing is relatively easy to secure – either through university apartments or the abundant private housing around – and students can find options to fit various budgets.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> UT Southwestern’s student body is large (roughly 240 per class), but it’s subdivided into colleges (the school has a learning community system with several “Academic Colleges” that group students across all four years for mentoring and social events). This system helps create smaller cohorts, giving students a sense of belonging and support. The culture at UTSW is often described as collaborative and studious. Despite being highly competitive to get into, once in, students tend to be friendly, down-to-earth and focused on helping each other. Study groups form readily, and the Student Government and other organizations ensure that class feedback is heard to continuously improve the experience.</p>
  <p>There are a plethora of student organizations – everything from specialty interest groups (nearly every specialty has a student interest group given the size of the school) to community service orgs (UTSW students volunteer at places like the Union Gospel Mission Clinic, and programs like United to Serve which is an annual community health fair). Given the research environment, there are also organizations linking MD and PhD trainees for scientific discussions. UTSW has chapters of national honor societies like AOA and GHHS, which become active in promoting humanism and leadership. Socially, the students make time for fun amidst hard work: there are informal intramural teams (soccer, basketball) often in friendly rivalry with students from other Dallas health training programs. The “Southwestern Hoedown” is a long-standing annual tradition – a big country-western themed party that all classes attend to blow off steam. Being in Dallas, students also partake in city life together – group outings to Texas State Fair in the fall (a must-do Dallas event), attending concerts, or trying famous BBQ joints. The presence of a large class means you can always find classmates who share your interests, whether it’s rock climbing at a local gym or forming a band (UTSW has a student band that plays at events). Importantly, the faculty at UTSW are often praised as approachable and invested in teaching despite their lofty research credentials. Many big-name researchers still enthusiastically lead first-year small groups or rounds on the wards, and they mentor students for research or career guidance. That creates a culture of high expectations but also high support – students are pushed to excel but given abundant resources to do so. In summary, life at UT Southwestern is intense but rewarding: students are part of an elite medical community with every opportunity at their fingertips, set in a lively big city, and they forge lifelong friendships through the shared challenges and successes of a top-tier medical education.</p>
