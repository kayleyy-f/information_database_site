  <h1>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center – Paul L. Foster School of Medicine (El Paso)</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classes begin:</strong> Early July. Foster SOM operates on an accelerated academic calendar; incoming first-year students often begin classes in July (a few weeks earlier than many schools) to incorporate expanded clinical and Spanish language training in the curriculum.</li>
    <li><strong>Campus type:</strong> Urban border city. The Foster SOM campus is in El Paso, Texas, a large city on the U.S.-Mexico border. The medical school is co-located with Texas Tech’s El Paso campus and University Medical Center, giving it an urban campus feel in a unique bicultural community.</li>
    <li><strong>Application deadline:</strong> Primary application due Oct. 1 (TMDSAS). Secondary application deadlines around Nov. 15. Being a Texas state school, Foster SOM follows the TMDSAS timeline (including the match in February for Texas residents).</li>
    <li><strong>Mission:</strong> The mission of TTUHSC El Paso Paul L. Foster SOM is “to provide an outstanding education and development opportunities for our diverse learning community, serve the needs of our border community, and improve the lives of people in our State and our community”:contentReference[oaicite:60]{index=60}. In practice, this translates to a focus on educating culturally competent physicians who are prepared to serve in West Texas and US-Mexico border regions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>The Foster School of Medicine in El Paso offers a curriculum uniquely tailored to its border setting. One hallmark is the <em>Society, Community, and Individual</em> (SCI) course that runs longitudinally and includes medical Spanish language training for all students, ensuring graduates can communicate effectively with Spanish-speaking patients (a critical skill in El Paso):contentReference[oaicite:63]{index=63}:contentReference[oaicite:64]{index=64}. The curriculum is organized in integrated organ-system blocks and incorporates case-based learning and early clinical exposure. Students begin interacting with patients early through a standardized patient program and community clinics. A distinctive feature at Foster SOM is the required scholarly activity – many students undertake community-based research or quality improvement projects addressing border health issues such as diabetes, infectious disease, or healthcare access.</p>
  <p>Research opportunities at Foster SOM are growing, supported by TTUHSC El Paso’s research centers like the Center of Emphasis in Diabetes & Metabolism and the Center of Emphasis in Infectious Diseases. Given its relative newness (first class admitted in 2009), the school is actively expanding its research infrastructure. Students can work with faculty on projects often related to the health needs of the region (for example, genetic factors in Hispanic populations, or public health interventions for the border community). The school also offers an optional Research Track for interested students and encourages publication and presentation – for instance, many students present at the annual campus research colloquium. While research is available, Foster SOM places somewhat more emphasis on clinical training and service. The institution’s mission of serving the community manifests in extensive service-learning (students frequently volunteer in colonias and rural clinics), and research often ties into service (like studying outcomes of a community health worker program). The importance of research is recognized as part of being a well-rounded physician, but the culture leans toward producing compassionate clinicians who can also engage in practical, community-driven research rather than purely bench scientists. Overall, the education at Foster SOM combines rigorous medical training, a commitment to cultural competency (especially bilingual skills), and regionally relevant research and service to shape physicians for West Texas and beyond.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees approximately $22,937 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:65]{index=65}. (With living costs, in-state total COA ~$67k/year. Foster SOM’s tuition is relatively low thanks to state support.)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees approximately $37,971 per year for non-residents:contentReference[oaicite:66]{index=66}. (Out-of-state COA ~$82k/year. Foster SOM does accept out-of-state applicants, though the majority of each class is in-state; non-residents can often establish Texas residency after the first year to benefit from lower tuition.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> The Foster SOM campus is part of TTUHSC El Paso, adjacent to the University Medical Center of El Paso and the El Paso Children’s Hospital. This creates a self-contained academic medical center in central El Paso. The city of El Paso itself is large (nearly 700,000 population) but has a very distinct bi-cultural (Texan and Mexican) atmosphere. Students experience a mix of American and Mexican culture in daily life – from the language spoken to the food and festivals (like the annual Sun Bowl college football game or local fiestas). The Franklin Mountains run through the city, offering hiking and outdoor adventure close by, and the weather is generally sunny and dry year-round.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Many students opt to live in apartments or houses near the medical center (in neighborhoods like Kern Place or Mission Hills) or in other popular areas of El Paso such as the Westside. The cost of living in El Paso is quite affordable; students often can rent a comfortable one-bedroom or share a house for much less than in bigger Texas cities. Some students even live just across the state line in New Mexico (Sunland Park/Santa Teresa areas) and commute a short distance. Given El Paso’s spread-out nature, most students have cars – parking is available on campus. Traffic in El Paso is manageable, so commutes are typically short. The school’s administration provides resources and contacts for incoming students to find roommates or recommended housing, easing the transition especially for those not originally from the area.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> Paul L. Foster SOM is known for its strong sense of community and mission. With class sizes around 100, students really get to know each other, and teamwork is emphasized in the curriculum (through learning societies and group case-based activities). The student body is very diverse, with a high proportion of Hispanic students and many first-generation medical students, mirroring the community it serves. This diversity and shared purpose fosters an environment that is welcoming and inclusive. Students often bond over learning medical Spanish together – it’s common to find study groups also practicing conversational Spanish or celebrating each other’s cultures. Student organizations are active: for instance, the Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA) is prominent, as is the local chapter of the American Medical Women’s Association (AMWA). Because of the school’s border location, there are unique service clubs like the Medical Spanish Club (which not only practices language but also does outreach in Spanish-speaking communities) and the Colonia Health Initiative where students travel to underserved colonias. The school hosts an annual banquet called “Foster Fiesta” which showcases cultural performances and foods. Another beloved event is “Conversion Day” – a day when second-year students symbolically shift to their clinical phase and often a celebration is held. The faculty at Foster are praised as approachable mentors; many have lived in El Paso long-term and treat students like extended family, inviting them to local events or holiday gatherings. Outside of campus, students enjoy El Paso’s offerings together – whether trying out famous local Tex-Mex restaurants, attending downtown street festivals, or taking weekend trips to nearby attractions (like White Sands National Park in NM or Big Bend a few hours away). In summary, life at Foster SOM is defined by a tight-knit, family-like student culture deeply engaged with the border community, a rich blend of cultures, and the collective enthusiasm of being part of a relatively new and innovative medical school making a difference in its region.</p>
