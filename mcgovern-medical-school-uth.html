        <h2>Education & Research</h2>
        <p>
          McGovern offers a two-year foundational science curriculum followed by two years of clinical rotations. 
          Pre-clinical active-learning includes case-based sessions and simulation labs.  
          Research opportunities abound via affiliations with MD Anderson, Memorial Hermann, the Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, and other TMC institutions.  
          Students may join summer research programs, pursue an optional Scholarly Concentration (e.g. Global Health, Medical Education), or participate in quality improvement projects.  
          While research is not required for graduation, many students engage in projects under faculty mentorship, reflecting McGovern’s mission to advance discovery alongside clinical training.

        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Setting:</strong> Immersed in a dynamic urban environment, students can walk from lectures to hospital rounds within TMC.  
          Houston’s arts, sports, parks, and food scene offer plenty of off-duty options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Housing:</strong> No on-campus dorms; students rent nearby in TMC area, Midtown, Montrose, or West University. 
          UTHealth Student Residences and other subsidized options exist. METRO rail, biking, and walking are feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Culture:</strong> Class size ~240 fosters a collaborative “advisory college” system for mentoring across years.  
          50+ student organizations (clinical interest, service, wellness, leadership), HOMES Clinic for Houston’s homeless, and inter-school activities with other TMC institutions.  
          Wellness is emphasized via intramural sports, fitness center access, and student-run events.
