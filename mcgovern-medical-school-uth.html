  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>McGovern Medical School offers a robust educational program with deep clinical integration thanks to its location in Houston’s Texas Medical Center. The curriculum is structured with two years of foundational science followed by two years of clinical rotations. McGovern emphasizes active learning; for example, case-based learning sessions and simulation lab training are part of the pre-clinical experience. When it comes to research, McGovern provides abundant opportunities. As part of UTHealth Houston, the medical school is affiliated with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Hermann Hospital, and other TMC institutions, giving students the chance to engage in high-level research across disciplines. Students can participate in summer research programs after the first year, and there is an optional Scholarly Concentration program (in areas like Research, Medical Education, Global Health, etc.) for those who want a structured scholarly project. McGovern’s faculty are known for research in fields such as neuroscience, cardiology, genetics, and public health. Notably, the medical school houses the Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, where cutting-edge biomedical research takes place. While research is not a graduation requirement for the MD program, a large portion of McGovern students do get involved in research projects or quality improvement initiatives, supported by the school’s Office of Research. The importance of research at McGovern is evident in its mission to “discover” and its encouragement of innovation in medical training. However, McGovern also stays true to its primary purpose of training clinicians – the curriculum and numerous clinical partners ensure that students have a well-rounded education balancing both scientific inquiry and patient-centered practice.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $26,094 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. (Including living costs, in-state COA is roughly $62k/year. McGovern, like other UT schools, keeps tuition relatively low for Texans.)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $33,749 per year for non-residents:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}. (Out-of-state COA ~ $69k/year. Texas law allows non-resident students who receive certain scholarships or meet criteria to pay in-state tuition after year one, potentially reducing debt.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> McGovern Medical School is set in a dynamic urban environment. Being in the Texas Medical Center, students are immersed in a bustling healthcare city-within-a-city. They can walk to lectures and also to hospital rounds at Memorial Hermann or Harris Health LBJ Hospital. Houston provides big-city living – diverse neighborhoods, arts (the Theater District, museums), professional sports, and renowned food scenes. For students, this means plenty of options to unwind outside of class, from catching an Astros baseball game to exploring Houston’s extensive parks and bayou greenways.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Most McGovern students live off-campus in nearby areas. Popular choices include apartments in the Texas Medical Center area (many high-rise apartments cater to medical professionals), as well as neighborhoods like Midtown, Montrose, or West University for a different vibe. Housing costs vary, but Houston’s cost of living is moderate. Some students take advantage of subsidized housing options: UTHealth offers the <em>UTHealth Student Residences</em>, and other institutions in TMC have student housing in which McGovern students sometimes find spots. Commuting by car is common (McGovern provides parking options), though some students live close enough to bike or walk. Public transportation (METRO rail) has a stop near the medical school, making it feasible to live along the light rail line without a car.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> McGovern has a large student body (one of the largest medical school classes in the country, with ~240 students per class), but it maintains a collaborative culture. Classes are known to be friendly and supportive, with upperclassmen mentoring underclassmen (the school’s advisory colleges system pairs students across years). With so many students, almost every interest finds a group: there are over 50 student organizations, including specialty interest groups for every field, a thriving Student Government Association, musical and artistic groups (McGovern students put on an annual talent show and participate in the TMC Orchestra), and numerous outreach initiatives. Community service is significant – McGovern students run the HOMES Clinic for Houston’s homeless population on weekends, and many volunteer with the San Jose Clinic and other local charities. The school’s diversity is celebrated through events such as a yearly Culture Night. Given McGovern’s size and setting, students also enjoy an interdisciplinary social life, mingling with students from other TMC schools (like Baylor, UTHealth’s other programs, etc.). There’s a healthy balance between work and life; while academics are rigorous, the administration and student body emphasize wellness. There are organized intramural sports leagues within the TMC, and McGovern even has access to UTHealth’s fitness center and recreation programs. In summary, life at McGovern Medical School offers the excitement and opportunities of a big-city, large-class environment, but with intentional structures (colleges, mentoring, organizations) to ensure each student finds community and support amid the hustle and bustle.</p>
