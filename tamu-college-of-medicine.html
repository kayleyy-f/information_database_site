  <h1>Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Classes begin:</strong> Early August. The incoming first-year class typically starts in early August after orientation in late July.</li>
    <li><strong>Campus type:</strong> Multi-campus (small city/suburban). Texas A&M’s College of Medicine has a unique distributed campus system: pre-clinical training is based in Bryan/College Station (a classic college town), and clinical training occurs at several campuses (Bryan/College Station, Temple, Dallas, Houston, and Round Rock). The main campus environment in College Station is suburban/college-town, while clinical campuses range from urban (Dallas/Houston) to smaller city (Temple).</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>Texas A&M College of Medicine offers a comprehensive medical education with the added dimension of multiple campus experiences. The pre-clinical curriculum can be completed either in Bryan/College Station or at one of the distributed sites (depending on the student’s assignment), but all follow a synchronized curriculum emphasizing foundational sciences integrated with early clinical training. By third year, students are assigned to a primary clinical campus (options include Temple – in partnership with Baylor Scott & White, Dallas – at Texas A&M’s Dallas campus/Baylor University Medical Center, Houston – at Houston Methodist, Round Rock, or stay in Bryan/College Station). This allows for a wide variety of clinical settings: from tertiary care centers in big cities to community hospitals in smaller cities. Despite the geographic spread, Texas A&M ensures that all students receive comparable experiences and can return to College Station for certain collective events and electives.</p>
  <p>Research is an important part of Texas A&M’s identity. The College encourages medical student research through its Summer Research Program and an optional year-long Research Honors Program. Areas of research strength include health innovations for rural populations, military medicine (A&M has strong ties to the military community), engineering and medicine intersection (A&M offers an innovative EnMed program – an MD/MEng degree – although that is separate from the core MD). The mission to improve health for Texans is evident in research initiatives addressing underserved needs – for example, studies on telemedicine for rural clinics, or on diseases prevalent in Texas such as diabetes and obesity. Students interested in research find mentors at any of the campuses or within the extensive Texas A&M University system. The school’s broad definition of scholarship also means students can do quality improvement projects or community-based research. While not every student engages in lab research, the institution’s culture of discovery underscores its mission to advance knowledge in service of health. In summary, Texas A&M provides a well-rounded education with flexibility in clinical experiences and a supportive environment for research, all oriented toward producing physicians who will serve and lead in Texas and beyond.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees roughly $21,760 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}, which is relatively low. (In-state total COA with living ~$52k/year; Texas A&M is known for affordable tuition.)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees roughly $34,860 per year for non-residents:contentReference[oaicite:59]{index=59}. (Out-of-state total COA ~$65k/year. However, non-resident students often obtain Texas residency after the first year, significantly lowering tuition costs in subsequent years.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Texas A&M’s College of Medicine offers a distinctive campus life because students may spend time in different cities. The primary campus in College Station is a true college town environment – Texas A&M University’s main campus is lively with collegiate spirit (SEC football games, traditions like the Aggie Muster and Midnight Yell). Medical students in Bryan/College Station enjoy access to all main campus facilities and a traditional university atmosphere, albeit their classes take place at the Health Science Center slightly off the main campus. Clinical years might be spent in Temple (a smaller city with a major health system), Dallas (urban living in one of the nation’s largest metro areas), Houston (another major urban center), Round Rock (suburban Austin), or remaining in Bryan/College Station. This means campus life can vary: some will experience a quiet, student-centric life in College Station, while others will dive into big-city life in Dallas or Houston during rotations. The College tries to build unity through periodic all-campus events and an orientation that brings everyone together early on.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> In College Station/Bryan, many med students live in apartments or rental homes near the Health Science Center or around the university. The cost of living is quite low in the area. It’s not uncommon for med students to live in the same complexes as other graduate students or even rent houses together. On clinical campuses, housing is typically up to the student: for instance, in Temple, the school provides some guidance on apartments near Baylor Scott & White Hospital; in Dallas or Houston, students often find housing close to the hospitals or in safe residential neighborhoods convenient to their rotation sites. This adaptability is part of the Aggie med student experience. Fortunately, all the rotation cities have a relatively reasonable cost of living compared to national averages (even Dallas and Houston, while larger, have many affordable options), and Texas A&M has support staff to help students transition when they move to a new site.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> Despite the geographic spread, Texas A&M College of Medicine works hard to maintain a cohesive culture defined by the “Aggie” values of camaraderie, service, and tradition. Students form strong bonds during their first two years together in College Station (or their regional pre-clinical campus), and they often keep in close touch even when dispersed for rotations. Technology like video conferences is used to include students from all campuses in meetings of interest groups or town halls. There is an active Student Government Association that has representation from each clinical site, ensuring that every student stays connected. School traditions include the annual White Coat Ceremony at the main campus, a Second Look Day for all matches after the TMDSAS Match, and a graduation that brings everyone back together in Bryan/College Station. Student organizations cover the gamut: from specialty interest groups to the Aggie Physician’s Alliance which coordinates community health fairs across different regions at the same time. Community service is strong – for example, many students volunteer at “Brazos Valley” health clinics during pre-clinical years, and those in Dallas/Houston might volunteer at local free clinics there, all under the Aggie med banner. An interesting aspect of student life is the connection with undergraduate Aggieland: med students often partake in some university traditions like football games (many enjoy attending Aggie games at Kyle Field wearing their white coats for fun) or go to the MSC (Memorial Student Center) on main campus for studying to feel the broader campus energy. The Aggie alumni network is famously loyal, and that extends to the medical school – each student is considered part of the larger Aggie Network. Upperclassmen mentor underclassmen, and everyone – whether in Temple, Round Rock, or Bryan – feels the collective school spirit. In conclusion, Texas A&M’s medical students enjoy a supportive, service-oriented culture with a dose of Aggie tradition, and they adapt to multiple environments, essentially getting the best of both worlds: a tight-knit medical school community and the expansive Aggie family across Texas.</p>
