        <h2>Education &amp; Research</h2>
        <p>
          Pre-clinical curriculum can be taken in Bryan/College Station or at a distributed site.  
          Clinical years rotate through five campuses—from large urban centers (Dallas, Houston) to smaller cities (Temple, Round Rock).  
          Research opportunities include the Summer Research Program, the Research Honors Program, and community-focused projects (telemedicine for rural clinics, diabetes, obesity).  
          EnMed (MD/MEng) is offered separately; MD/PhD and MD/MPH tracks are also available within the Texas A&amp;M system.  
          The college’s emphasis on rural, military, and underserved-population health aligns research with its mission.

        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Setting:</strong> Bryan/College Station offers classic college-town life (Aggie traditions, SEC football, Muster, Midnight Yell).  
          During clinical years, students live in Temple, Dallas, Houston, or Round Rock—each with its own local amenities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Housing:</strong> Apartments and houses near each campus; Bryan has low cost of living, clinical sites offer guided listings and on-site options.  
          Commuting by car is common; parking is provided at all campuses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Culture:</strong> A unified Aggie spirit despite geographic spread—shared White Coat Ceremony, student government representation at each site, and common events.  
          Student organizations cover specialties, service, wellness, and community outreach.  
          Strong alumni network (“Aggie Network”) and inter-campus mentoring keep students connected.
