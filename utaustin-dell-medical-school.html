  <ul>
    <li><strong>Median MCAT:</strong> ~514. Dell’s entering class has a median MCAT around 514:contentReference[oaicite:82]{index=82}, reflecting a very competitive academic profile (top ~90th percentile).</li>
    <li><strong>Median GPA:</strong> ~3.78. The median GPA is about 3.78:contentReference[oaicite:83]{index=83}. Dell admits academically strong students but also heavily weighs leadership, innovation, and background diversity, resulting in slightly broader metrics rather than perfect scores.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>
  <p>Dell Medical School’s curriculum is deliberately innovative and distinct. The four-year MD program is structured as 1) foundational science year, 2) clinical year, 3) a hallmark “Innovation, Leadership, and Discovery” (ILD) year, and 4) a residency preparation year. In the first year, students learn basic sciences in an integrated, case-based format with an emphasis on team-based learning rather than traditional lectures. The second year consists of core clinical clerkships. The entire third year is what sets Dell apart: during this ILD year, students pursue a personal “Innovation project” or earn a dual degree or certificate (many get a Master’s in Business, Public Health, or Engineering, or a certificate in Health Care Design). This year allows each student to delve deeply into a problem in healthcare and develop a solution – aligning with Dell’s mission to redefine health. The fourth year then includes advanced clinical rotations tailored to students’ chosen specialties and leadership training.</p>
  <p>Research at Dell Med is strongly oriented toward health systems innovation and population health, though traditional biomedical research is also present via UT Austin’s labs. Students have opportunities to work with the school’s <em>Design Institute for Health</em> (a unique collaboration with the College of Fine Arts focused on applying design thinking to healthcare challenges) or with the <em>Texas Health CoLab</em> to develop and test new care models and technologies. Many student projects during the third year lead to pilot programs within Austin’s health community – for example, improving care for the homeless, designing better mental health delivery, etc. Dell also has more conventional research opportunities through UT Austin’s Dell Pediatric Research Institute and collaborations with engineering and computer science departments (e.g., in AI for medicine or novel medical devices). The emphasis, however, is less on bench research for its own sake and more on actionable research that can translate quickly to better care models. Dell’s view of research and education is interwoven: every student is expected to become a “change agent” in healthcare, and the school provides the mentorship and resources (both in academic research and in community organizations) to support that. Thus, research and scholarly inquiry at Dell are highly valued, but often in non-traditional forms like community-based participatory research, value-based care analytics, or healthcare redesign. Dell’s approach is quite cutting-edge, and as such, they attract faculty who are leaders in fields like healthcare policy, population health, and informatics in addition to traditional clinical research. All told, Dell Medical School provides a forward-thinking educational experience with research and innovation at its core, aiming to produce physicians who will not only practice medicine but also transform it.</p>

  <h2>Tuition, Aid & Debt</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (In-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $21,087 per year for Texas residents:contentReference[oaicite:84]{index=84}. (Total in-state COA including living expenses is around $61k/year. Dell Medical School has relatively low tuition due to state funding and some local scholarship support.)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of attendance (Out-of-state):</strong> Tuition and fees about $35,406 per year for non-residents:contentReference[oaicite:85]{index=85}. (Total out-of-state COA ~$75k/year. Dell admits only a small number of out-of-state students – the majority are in-state. Out-of-state students can potentially establish residency by the second year or may receive aid to offset costs, given Dell’s commitment to minimizing debt where possible.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Campus Life</h2>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Dell Medical School is embedded in the bustling city of Austin, often touted as one of the most vibrant cities in the U.S. The medical school buildings (including the Health Learning Building and Health Discovery Building) are modern facilities across from UT’s new teaching hospital (Dell Seton Medical Center). Being on UT Austin’s campus means students can tap into the university’s rich resources and youthful energy. Austin provides a mix of government, tech, music, and art scenes, so there is always something happening – from the SXSW festival to live music concerts any night of the week. For students, this means a high quality of life outside of class: Zilker Park, Lady Bird Lake’s hike-and-bike trail, and endless eateries (Austin is famous for tacos and food trucks) are at their doorstep.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Austin’s popularity has raised the cost of living, but Dell students manage by living in various neighborhoods and often with roommates. Some choose to live in downtown or West Campus apartments to be walking distance to the med school. Others opt for slightly more distant neighborhoods like Hyde Park, Mueller, or South Austin, which have lower rents and a short drive or bus ride to campus. UT Austin has graduate student housing, but many Dell students find better deals off-campus. Parking at the med school is available via a permit in nearby garages. Importantly, Dell’s central location means some students go car-free, using bikes or public transit (Austin’s buses and expanding train system) to get around, or even electric scooters that are ubiquitous downtown. Many students also take advantage of being part of the UT community to access campus shuttle buses. Overall, housing is one of the few challenges due to Austin’s growth, but the medical school’s financial aid office and upperclassmen provide guidance on good spots and how to budget. The lively Austin lifestyle – living near music venues, jogging by the lake, or studying at hip coffee shops – often compensates for any housing cost concerns.</p>
  <p><strong>Campus culture:</strong> Dell Medical School’s culture can be described as entrepreneurial, collaborative, and mission-driven. With small class sizes (~50 students per class initially, growing to around 75), students get to know each other extremely well and often work together on projects. The atmosphere is not the traditional high-pressure med school; instead, it’s more akin to a startup incubator where students are passionate about innovation and improving systems. There are still plenty of traditional student organizations (interest groups in surgery, internal medicine, etc., and groups like AMSA and Gold Humanism Honor Society), but many have an Austin twist – for example, a Healthcare Innovation Club, a Design in Medicine interest group, etc. Because Dell is new (first class in 2016) and purpose-built with a different philosophy, students and faculty share a pioneering spirit. This creates a sense of everyone being on the same team to build a new model of medical education. Faculty mentors (called “coaches”) guide students not just academically but in career and leadership development. Wellness and work-life balance are emphasized; students get dedicated time for self-directed learning and personal growth, which they often use to explore Austin’s scenes or just recharge. Outside academics, Dell students have integrated with the UT community, joining intramural sports or attending Longhorns football games together – taking advantage of big-university perks. They also engage heavily with the community: it’s common for students to volunteer with nonprofits targeting homelessness or mental health, reflecting the school’s community-centric mission. Being in Austin, many students bond over attending music festivals or outdoor adventures in the Texas Hill Country on weekends. In summary, the life of a Dell med student is academically rigorous but uniquely enriched by Austin’s innovative and cultural environment. Students feel they are part of something groundbreaking at Dell, and that camaraderie, combined with the city’s eclectic offerings, results in a highly satisfying and exciting med school experience.</p>
